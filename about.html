            The Toledo Celtics Soccer Club was founded in 1987 by Lee Aliakbar and Dr. James King. Our then very small club began by coaching players ages 15-18. It did not take us long, however, to realize that we could offer much more to northwest Ohio. By coaching players beginning as young as seven years old, we began to have much more time to teach younger players our methods as it could sometimes be difficult to get an entire team of older players to adapt to our play style.

            As we became more and more popular, we decided to add a second program to our organization: The Toledo Leprechauns. This program was established to allow players ages 3-14 to develop at a lower level. The Leprechauns do not have to tryout and anyone can play. As they develop, they are given the opportunity to try out and play for the higher-level Toledo Celtics. Our common values are what set us apart from other clubs in the area. We teach players our methods, which all of our coaches agree on and implement the same way. Players are not told one thing from one coach and then something totally different from another. We find fitness to be a very important part of the game, as well as technical training and personal traits such as loyalty and respect.
