            The Toledo Celtics Soccer Club provides the soccer experience that players have been seeking for years. Our coaches, many of whom have played soccer professionally, are highly qualified individuals who truly care about the success of their players. Our strategies are unlike those of any other clubs in the area, as we teach our own brand of soccer. These strategies can seem harsh at first, but in the long run they always prove to be the most efficient. We value loyalty, commitment, effort, and most of all, respect. Rather than running through generic drills and scrimmages, we target what we know you need to improve on and work with you to make you the best player you can be.
